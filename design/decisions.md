# Design decisions — the record

This file holds **one rule** and the log it governs. It is the permanent record of what
was decided; [`TODO.md`](../TODO.md) is the impermanent record of what is still open.
An item that gets answered is **deleted** from `TODO.md` and **appears here**.

---

## The rule

**1. The PDF is the source of truth.**
`Ascendant_Impact_Assignment_02_Revised_GDD_Anthony.pdf` (v0.4, 2026-07-24) outranks
every other document in this repository — this file, `project-brief.md`,
`design-brief.md`, `combat-integration-plan.md`, the assignment-04 knowledge base, and
anything said in a session. If any of them disagrees with the PDF, the PDF wins.

**2. `gdd/` is generated and is never hand-edited.**
`gdd/sections/`, `gdd/reference/`, `gdd/INDEX.md`, and
`gdd/ascendant-impact-gdd-v0.4.md` are all mechanically derived from the PDF. Editing
any of them by hand silently forks the source of truth and there is no way to detect it
afterwards. **To change what `gdd/` says, change the PDF and re-export.** If a
description in `gdd/reference/` is wrong, fix the description by re-reading the image —
never by writing in what you believe the art should show.

**3. Every answer recorded here gets a dated entry** naming:
- **what it resolves** — the `TODO.md` item number and its Q / V id, so the deletion
  from `TODO.md` is traceable;
- **the decision**, stated plainly enough to implement from;
- **who decided it and when**;
- **any GDD line it supersedes** — quoted, with its `gdd/sections/` file and PDF page.

**4. The moment an entry supersedes a GDD line, `TODO.md` gains an item** stating that
the GDD is out of date. **Clearing that item means Adrian updates the source PDF,
re-exports it, and re-extracts `gdd/`** — not editing `gdd/` and not leaving the two
out of step. Until the PDF is updated, the GDD remains the source of truth *and* is
known-stale, which is the worst state to be in silently and an acceptable state to be
in visibly.

**Superseding the GDD is a real act.** Most decisions will not do it. A decision that
merely fills a value the GDD never specified — which is what most of `TODO.md` is —
supersedes nothing. A decision that contradicts something the GDD actually says does,
and triggers rule 4.

## Log

**No entries yet.**

Nothing has been decided since this file was created on 2026-08-02, so nothing
supersedes the GDD and rule 4 has not fired. `TODO.md` records this explicitly under
"Not yet triggered" so the absence is deliberate rather than an oversight.

### Entry format
